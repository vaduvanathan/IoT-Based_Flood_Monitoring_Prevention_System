# IoT-Based Flood Monitoring Prevention System for Terrain and Subway Region

## Project Overview

This project implements an **IoT-Based Flood Monitoring Prevention System** designed specifically for critical areas like terrain and subway regions. The system aims to provide real-time monitoring of water levels and environmental conditions to prevent severe flood damage and enhance public safety.

## Key Features

* **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously tracks water levels and environmental parameters.
* **Early Warning System:** Designed to provide timely alerts for flood prevention.
* **Data Analysis:** Utilizes collected data for predictive analysis (details in report).
* **Targeted Application:** Focused on terrain and subway regions for high-impact prevention.

## Hardware Components Used

*(Note: The specific hardware components were not detailed in the provided project report snippet. Please replace the examples below with the actual components you used in your system.)*

* **Microcontroller/Development Board:** E.g., ESP32, ESP8266, Arduino Uno/Mega
* **Water Level Sensors:** E.g., Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), Float switches, Capacitive water level sensor
* **Rainfall Sensor:** E.g., Rain gauge, Tipping bucket sensor
* **Communication Module:** E.g., Wi-Fi module, GSM/GPRS module
* **Power Supply:** Battery or external power source
* **Alerting Mechanism:** E.g., Buzzer, LED indicators, Relay for external devices

## Software/Technologies Used
